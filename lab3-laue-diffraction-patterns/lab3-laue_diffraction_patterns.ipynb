    "## Lab Summary\n",
    "You will use the Laue Back Scattering technique to determine the crystallographic orientation of a single crystal. You will first acquire a diffraction pattern with the incident beam normal to the surface of the crystal. Then you will re-orient the crystal to a different plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction: \n",
    "The Laue method records the x-ray diffraction pattern on a CCD camera, image plate or photographic film. The Back Reflection Laue technique is for high x-ray absorbing samples at diffraction angles $2\\theta$ between $120°$ and $180°$. The Forward Reflection Laue method is used for $0° \\leq 2 \\theta \\leq 60°$ but is suitable only with low absorbing samples like polymers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Laue methods are used for several purposes, one of the most important applications is to determine the orientation of single crystals. Well-grown crystals have habits (shapes or facets) that indicate the symmetry possessed by the lattice on which the crystal was \"constructed\". But, if a crystal is poorly formed or was made in such a way that facet development is prevented, X-rays can be used to determine the presence and orientation of planes within a crystal using Bragg Diffraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bragg Diffraction (or Bragg Scattering) only occurs when: \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1.</b> The Bragg condition is satisfied,\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "n\\lambda = 2d_{hkl}sin(\\theta)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2.</b> $\\vec{r^*_{hkl}}$, the normal to a plane $hkl$, bisects the incident and diffracted x-ray beams, as shown in the figure below.\n",

    "    <FIGCAPTION><b>Fig. 1</b>: <i>Schematics for Back and Forward Reflection Laue modes.</i></FIGCAPTION></center>\n",
    "</FIGURE><br>\n",
    "Crystals have many sets of $hkl$ planes with different Bragg spacings $d_{hkl}$ and different directions defined by $\\vec{r^*_{hkl}}$. To ensure that the Bragg condition will be satisfied for many of these $hkl$'s, a large range of wavelengths ($\\lambda$’s) are supplied by the white (or Bremsstrahlung) radiation of the x-ray tube. Generally Mo or W anode X-ray tubes are used for Laue because of the greater white component to their spectrum at lower operating voltages - but any target material (e.g. Cu, Cr, etc.) is suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incident x-rays are collimated into a beam, pass through a hole in the 2D detector plane, and strike the sample. X-rays backscatter onto the camera where the pattern is recorded. The sample is mounted on a **goniostat**, a device that permits the rotation of the sample about its horizontal and vertical axes, which are both oriented perpendicular to the direction of the incident X-ray beam. The sample is mounted such that rotation of the sample along its horizontal and vertical axes does not result in displacements in the $x-$ or $y-$ directions.\n",

    "We want to align the MgO sample such that it is positioned **30 mm** away from the detection plane. In addition, we want to ensure that the surface of the MgO is coincident with the vertical and horizontal axes of rotation. To do this, we will mount the MgO crystal to a goniostat and subsequently adjust the position, horizontal angle, and vertical angle of the goniometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the instructor has not yet done so, mount the MgO crystal to the goniostat by *gently* pressing it onto the mounting clay adhered on the metal cylinder such that the crystal is approximately parallel to the front face of the cylinder. Using the peephole on the left side of the goniostat, adjust the position of the metal cylinder such that the forward face of the MgO slightly obscures the view through the peephole. Secure the cylinder to the goniostat by using the thumb screws.\n",

    "Next, we will align the goniostat forward along the rail such that the sample is 30 mm away from the detection plane. Slide the goniostat forward until the forward-most face of the goniostat touches the witness mark that has been drawn on the rail.\n",

    "### Part 2: Plotting Zones on a Stereographic Projection\n",
    "Stereographic projections map 3-D information onto a 2-D plane. They are useful for understanding symmetry in crystals since they convey information about the angular relationships between lattice planes. To understand how stereographic projections are generated, we will plot zones of interest on a Wulff net. \n",

Since the paper is confined in the $x$ and $y$ directions, it can freely rotate about the central axis of the Wulff net. Using the Wulff net as a measurement guide, stereographic projections can then then be drawn onto the tracing paper based on the $\\varepsilon$ and $\\gamma$ values obtained from the Greninger chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of doing this by hand, we will employ **Stereonet**, a software that plots orientation data and calculates rotation angles and intersections more precisely and quickly than by hand. If you have not yet downloaded this software, **Stereonet** can be downloaded using the link below:\n",

    "#### Using Stereonet\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Stereonet and ensure that appropriate settings are selected. \n",
    "    1. We want to make sure we are plotting on a Wulff net (equal angle net). Go to **View → Inspector → Stereonet tab → Projection → “Equal Angle.”**        \n",
    "2. Next, enter in the data obtained from reading the Greninger chart.\n",
    "    1. Go to **Data → New Dataset → Planes**. This will create a new dataset where we can define the 6 zones of interest. Rename the dataset by double-clicking on the dataset name in the Datasets Listbox at the top right corner of the screen.\n",
    "    2. Use the **Add Datum** button (in the Data Listbox on the bottom right corner of the screen) to add your 6 zones that you recorded in Part 1 into the planes dataset that you just defined.\n",
    "        1.\tIn the **Strike** column, enter in the $\\varepsilon$ value (rotation angle of the diffraction pattern).\n",
    "        2.\tIn the **Dip** column, enter in the complement of $\\gamma$ (e.g., $90° - $ the value from the Greninger chart).\n",
    "            - *Note*: we are taking the complement of $\\gamma$ to match the *Strike/Dip* convention in the Stereonet software. If we were doing this exercise by hand, we would rotate the Wulff net by $\\varepsilon$ and then draw great circles directly at $\\gamma$° away from the center line!\n",
    "        3.\tAssign a label to each datum (each great circle).\n",
    "3. Next, we will calculate the angular relationships between zones that fall on the same great circle. Go to **Calculations → Angle Between → Clicked points**, which will cause the *Angle Between Lines* dialog box to appear. Click on two zone intersections to find the interplanar angular distance between the two points. Record this value, either by taking a screenshot of the Stereonet screen and marking up the image or by making a table. To find a new interplanar angular distance, simply click on a new pair of points. \n",
    "    1. *Note*: If our Greninger chart measurements were completely precise, we could use Stereonet to calculate the plane intersections and the corresponding interplanar angles! Unfortunately, this isn't the case since we are reading angles by eye.\n",
    "4. Based on the observed symmetry in the Laue diffraction pattern, make an educated guess about the zone axis, given that the MgO crystal possesses cubic symmetry.\n",
    "5. Using the table of inter-axial angles below and your measured interplanar angles, index all intersecting zones. Due to the error in our measurement, consider all planes that fall within $\\pm3$° of your measured interplanar angle. Then, inspect other neighboring intersections and see if they make sense with the values in **Table 1** and with your intuitive knowledge about the spacing between different $hkl$ planes.\n",
    "    - *Note:* If you cannot match a pole, label it with a “?”. Bad guesses will be graded as incorrect. When you finish, you should find at least one pole to be a {111} or {110}. \n",
